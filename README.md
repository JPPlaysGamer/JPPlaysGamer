"Grettings. My name is JPPlaysGamer, who am i talking to?

You are now looking at my repository. Well, I think you’re looking for something, right?
If not, why are you here? I'm new here, I don't know anyone and I'm not from your country.

I almost feel alone, but I don't care. For me it's just the beginning. And you didn't answer my question, what do you do on GitHub? Just sign up?

Or your dream was to participate in a project. You can look like a good programmer ... 
You know, I'm not used to it, programming is something that came to me. I was born for this, and NO barrier ... 
and how are you? I'm the same, you ... think of something, you can think that all that I say is just to enter my repository,
nothing like that. I just talk about what we feel when we want to do something else. I do not control anyone it is something that you yourself or
whoever looks at it must know how to make their own decision."
